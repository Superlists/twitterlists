# Twitlists

A locally hosted web application that identifies the most popular tweets from a set of my personal Twitter lists and displays them in a Flask web application.


## **Set Up**

First, you'll need to apply for a Twitter developer account here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access

Once you've done this, open the "APIKeys" text file,  edit it to include your credentials, and follow the instructions to store your keys and tokens as operating system environment variables. 

To get started just run the following commands in your terminal/command prompt.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Twitlists/Twitlists-v1` 

2. `cd Twitlists-v1`

2. `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
	
3. `source venv/bin/activate`

4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. `python web.py`

6.  Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/  in your browser.
